## Biography

I work as technical leader, analyst and developer of applications and services, database-oriented, network-oriented or multi-purpose software. I'm also a Systems Administrator and a fan of [Python](http://www.python.org "Python Programming Language") as a programming language and Linux as Operating System.

I'm very passionate about technology, free and open source software, networking, information security and computer science.

I'm very curious, so I always find myself working, playing, investigating and experimenting mostly with free software. I try to write all my experiences in this blog when my spare time allows it.

I'm doing a Postgrade Course, a [Master in Data Networks](http://postgrado.info.unlp.edu.ar/Carrera/Magister/Redes%20de%20Datos/Magister%20en%20Redes%20de%20Datos.html) at [La Plata National University](http://www.unlp.edu.ar).
